      <h1>Overall Process - Website</h1>
        <p class="documentation">
          I found this website project to be yet another good exercise to practice CSS and some of its more indepth features. At this point, I know HTML pretty well.
          While there are some tags and syntax that I'm sure I haven't seen or used yet, at least for this project, it was the easiest part. However, CSS can get pretty
          complicated, especially when you start nesting selectors.
        </p>

        <p class="documentation">
          One of my biggest struggles was getting the header to format properly. The amount of nesting that went into it still surprises me. I also got the opportunity to
          try out new syntax, like embedding Google fonts. Google really goes all out when it comes to supporting developers, even when it comes to the design side.
          I also really enjoyed learning about media queries. It definitely makes responsive design much easier. I became a lot more comfortable with the &ltdiv&gt tag and I now
          realize how handy it can be. In terms of resources, CSS-Tricks.com was very helpful. Many of my questions were answered by this site, and I'm sure I will continue
          to utilize its wealth of information.
        </p>

      <h1>Overall Process - Game</h1>
        <p class="documentation">
          From prototyping to finalizing this game, its definitely been a fun challenge. I have made a few clone games in the past, but that's really all the game making
          experience I have had so far, so making an original game from scratch was interesting. However, with that said, I felt like I made good progress throughout coding
          this game. As simple as this game seems, there was a surprising amount of elements that had to be created for it to all work cohesively.
        </p>

        <p class="documentation">
          Pretty early on, I was able to get a working prototype of everything working. But, replacing all the circles and rectanlges with sprites and other visual elements took
          more time and effort than expected. A great source of information was the PixiJS tutorial made by kittykatattack on GitHub. It's made really well and specifically aimed
          towards people who have a basic understanding of JavaScript but don't know anything about PixiJS. The tutorial even included a great keyboard function which I used in
          the game which made inputs much easier to implement. Using the localStorage was also really fun. Storing high scores is cool to have in a game, and putting that feature
          in the game was pretty simple. Also, Howler is a great library for importing sounds very easily.
